Local Weather Application Part 1: Working with APIs

Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/rich-browser/weather && cd $_
Requirements

Use the OpenWeatherMap API to build an application that meets the following criteria.

given a user wants to view weather information
when the user visits your initial view
then there should be an input field to accept a zip code value

given a user wants to view weather information
when the user visits your initial view
then there should be a submit button next to the zip code field

given a user has entered in some text into the zip code field
when the user presses the enter key
or the user clicks the submit button
then the value should be validated as a zip code (5 digit number)

given the user has entered a valid zip code
when the user presses the enter key
or clicks the submit button
then the current weather for the provided zip code should be displayed, which includes

Temperature
Conditions
Air pressure
Wind speed
An affordance to view the forecast for the current day, the next three days, or the next 7 days
given the user is viewing the current forecast
when the user clicks on the link to view the 3 day forecast
then the current data (see above), and the data for the next 3 days should be displayed

given the user is viewing the current forecast
when the user clicks on the link to view the 7 day forecast
then the current data (see above), and the data for the next 7 days should be displayed

Note

Temperature is returned in Kelvin. You will need to add to the query string to get results in Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Fahrenheit: units=imperial
Celsius: units=metric
